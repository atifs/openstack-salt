Coding style testing 
====================

Formulas are pre-written Salt States. They are as open-ended as Salt States themselves and can be used for tasks such as installing a package, configuring, and starting a service, setting up users or permissions, and many other common tasks. They have certain rules that needs to be adhered.

Using double quotes with no variables
-------------------------------------

In general - it's a bad idea. All the strings which does not contain dynamic content ( variables ) should use single quote instead of double.


Line length above 80 characters
-------------------------------

As a 'standard code width limit' and for historical reasons - [IBM punch card](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card) had exactly 80 columns.

Single line declarations
------------------------

Avoid extending your code by adding single-line declarations. It makes your code much cleaner and easier to parse / grep while searching for those declarations.

No newline at the end of the file
---------------------------------

Each line should be terminated in a newline character, including the last one. Some programs have problems processing the last line of a file if it isn't newline terminated. [Stackoverflow thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/729692/why-should-files-end-with-a-newline)

Trailing whitespace characters
------------------------------

Trailing whitespaces take more spaces than necessary, any regexp based searches won't return lines as a result due to trailing whitespace(s).
