Vagrant deployment
==================

All-in-one (AIO) deployments are a great way to setup an OpenStack-Salt cloud for:

* a service development environment
* an overview of how all of the OpenStack services and roles play together
* a simple lab deployment for testing

Although AIO builds aren't recommended for large production deployments,
they're great for smal proof-of-concept deployments.

It's strongly recommended to have hardware that meets the following
requirements before starting an AIO build:

* CPU that supports `hardware-assisted virtualization`_
* At least 80GB disk space
* 16GB RAM
